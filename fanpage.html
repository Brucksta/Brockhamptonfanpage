        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Brockhampton are an American alternative hip hop group discovered in San Marcos, Texas, United States, in 2014. Led by Kevin Abstract and formed partially through the online forum "KanyeToThe", Brockhampton is a self-described boy band, which they use in a effort to redefine what it is to be a boyband. They combine a mixture of soulful singing, hiphop and american rap effortlessy in their songs, and their meaningful and diverse lyrics touch on issues faced within modern society. </p>
